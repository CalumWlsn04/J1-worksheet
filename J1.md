1) What is fault localization? Provide your answer using at least one bolded phrase using markdown

**Fault Localization** is a fancy way of saying this is you’re performing fault localization; you observe a program output that doesn’t match the expected output for some input, and now you need to fix one (or more) lines of code to get your program to work.

1) What are three benefits of Test Driven Development (TDD)? Provide your answer using an unordered list in markdown.

- Your tests are not biased by your code
- Writing tests helps you think about how you might write code
- Writing tests helps you think about the requirements of your system

3) Given the example of requirements for generating a password:

- Checks for letters, numbers and underscores, if there is anything else, it is bad
  - Checks for at least one uppercase letter
  - Checks for at least one lowercase letter
  - Checks for at least one number
- Check for no gmail in the password

4) Complete the truth table below to show what inputs we need to achieve active clause coverage for the following conditional : if ( ( (a > b) or G ) and (x < y) )

| a > b | G | x < y | Predicate outcome | Clause responsible |
|-------|---|-------|-------------------|--------------------|
|   1   | 0 |   0   |         0         |      (x < y)       |
|   1   | 1 |   0   |         0         |      (x < y)       |
|   1   | 1 |   1   |         1         |        Both        |
|   1   | 0 |   1   |         1         |        Both        |
|   0   | 1 |   0   |         0         |      (x < y)       |
|   0   | 1 |   1   |         1         |        Both        |
|   0   | 0 |   1   |         0         |   ((a > b) or G)   |
|   0   | 0 |   0   |         0         |        Both        |

5) Consider the control flow graph below. What are all the paths (using node numbers) that would achieve full path coverage as a test criteria? Is this a finite set?

Here are all of the path throughout the set from node 1 to node 7:
1->2->5->6->7
1->2->5->7
1->3->4->3->5->6->7
1->3->4->3->5->7
1->3->5->6->7
1->3->5->7

This is a infinite set because of the infinite loop at 3 to 4, which can theoretically run forever.
   
6) What benefit does mutation testing offer over other testing methods discussed in class? Use a link in markdown to link to the definition of mutation testing we have in our lecture notes from today.

  Mutation testing is beneficial over other testing methods in that we can test our test cases by **seeding faults** into our program, in order to further test the code to its limits. This is a necessary idea for debugging in a high industry standard. [This is a link to our notes on *mutation testing*](https://cs2113-f24.github.io/j/software_testing#syntactic-structures)

8) Finish the in-class exercise for finding the fault in the *checkCode* method.

   The fault in the checkCode() method is any space larger than 1 between words after the dot in the item codes.
